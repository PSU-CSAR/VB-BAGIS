Bagis depends on the Bagis class library to build successfully. The Bagis class library is located in the 
vb-bagis-class-library GitHub repository. You will need to add the Bagis class library project to the Bagis solution
and set a reference to it.

You may also receive a warning about a processor architecture mismatch. To fix this, use the Build Configuration
Manager to set the platform to x86 to match the ESRI libraries.
