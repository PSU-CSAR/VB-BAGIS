        <span style="font-weight: bold">Step 1: Find Site </span>finds a new site with the constraints 
        you specify.
        </p>
        <p>
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Step 2: Add New Site to Scenario 1 and Recalculate </span>adds 
        the new site to scenario 1 and recalculates scenario 1’s represented area.
        </p>
        <p>
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Step 3: Define a new site with the same settings </span>finds an 
        additional new site using the same constraints. Repeat <span style="font-weight: bold">Step 2</span>
        after <span style="font-weight: bold">Step 3</span> completes to update scenario 1's 
        represented area. Keep repeating <span style="font-weight: bold">Steps 2 and 3</span> until you have 
        the desired number of sites.
        </p>
        <p>
        Changing the constraints after <span style="font-weight: bold">Step 1</span> allows you to ignore the new site and find another site 
        (the <span style="font-weight: bold">Step 1</span> button will be reactivated).
        </p>
        <p>Editing the constraints after <span style="font-weight: bold">Step 2</span> allows you to find a subsequent site with different search settings.
        </p>
        <p>
        The last site created is saved in ArcMap’s memory so you can close the Pseudo Site 
        dialog window to view the Scenario/Site Representation maps. 
        </p>
        <p>
        To update the represented areas captured by the new site, you must add the last site 
        to Scenario 1 (by selecting the checkbox next to the site in the Scenario 1 grid on the 
        Site Scenario dialog window), and recalculate the represented areas (by clicking the Calculate 
        button on the Site Scenario dialog window).
        </p>
        <p>
        Selecting the log for any auto site will enable <span style="font-weight: bold">Step 3</span> and allow you to find another site with 
        the same search settings as the log site. In the same ArcMap session, if you select the log for 
        the site most recently added to the represented area calculation, <span style="font-weight: bold">Step 3</span> will finish faster 
        because BAGIS will re-use the cached constraint layers. If you terminate ArcMap, these cached layers 
        are deleted and can no longer be reused.
