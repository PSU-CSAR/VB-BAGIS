BAGIS is a Basin Analysis GIS used for water forecasting. BAGIS allows users to analyze basins, create AOI's, and generate 
high quality maps. 

BAGIS is written using VB .NET on the .NET 4.5 platform. BAGIS is delivered to users as an ESRI ArcMap add-in and is
compatible with ArcMap 10.5 or higher. Output from BAGIS can be used with BAGIS-H and BAGIS-P. 

BAGIS is maintained by a team of developers at Portland State University in cooperation with the USDA-NRCS National Water 
and Climate Center (NWCC)
